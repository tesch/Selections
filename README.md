**Selections** is a Mac utility for selecting items in Finder via regular expression matching. It can be used as a search tool, to quickly move a set of files, or to bulk apply contextual menu items such as cloud sync options, for example.

## Usage

Select a directory by either choosing from the *Open* dialog, dragging and dropping a folder onto the window, or simply by typing out a path in the upper text field with tab completion. Paths with an arbitrary combination of aliases and / or symlinks to directories are fully supported and get correctly resolved.

Enter a search term for the items you wish to select into the lower text field. This can be a simple keyword or a complex pattern. The matching items are shown in a list, from where they can be opened or previewed with Quick Look. Click *Select* or hit *Enter* to reveal your selection in the Finder.

*Undo* and *Redo* are supported for both text fields, maintaing their history even after loosing focus. Creating multiple windows works as well.
